Hereâ€™s a suggestion for SATB (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) voicing using your favorite General MIDI instruments, focusing on a blend of realism and complementary timbres, with both traditional and hybrid possibilities.

ðŸŽµ Soprano 1 (Sop1)

Suggested Voice:
	â€¢	64: Soprano Sax â€“ bright and agile, great for expressive melodic lines
	â€¢	72: Piccolo â€“ for a piercing, brilliant top line (if higher register is okay)
	â€¢	52: Choir Aahs â€“ if going for a choral texture

Alternative:
	â€¢	40: Violin â€“ smooth and expressive for lyrical soprano lines

ðŸŽµ Soprano 2 (Sop2)

Suggested Voice:
	â€¢	73: Flute â€“ softer, warmer than piccolo, blends beautifully
	â€¢	53: Voice Oohs â€“ subtle and supportive, works well in layered harmony

Alternative:
	â€¢	41: Viola â€“ to darken and thicken the upper soprano texture slightly
	â€¢	54: Synth Voice â€“ for a pad-like, atmospheric soprano line

ðŸŽ¶ Alto

Suggested Voice:
	â€¢	65: Alto Sax â€“ natural fit, rich midrange
